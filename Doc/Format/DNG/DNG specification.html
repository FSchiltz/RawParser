      <h2>DNG's relationship to standards</h2>
      <p>DNG isn't (yet) an ISO standard, nor a standard of any other <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standards_Organizations">standards development organization (SDO)</a>. But it is compatible with an ISO standard, and nearly all aspects of DNG are based on ISO or other standards. Here are the main ones. (This table will evolve to provide more links and information). </p>

The more pertinent question is whether camera manufacturers adopt the ISO standard, and we, the end users, will have to drive that...."</p></td>

      <h2>Version control in DNG files</h2>
      <p>DNG is designed to evolve. It has a version scheme built into it that allows the DNG specification, DNG writers, and DNG readers, to evolve at their own paces.</p>
      <p>So far, there have been 5 versions of the DNG specification. Version&nbsp;1.0.0.0 was published when DNG was launched in September&nbsp;2004, with the simultaneous release of "2.3" (ACR and DNG&nbsp;Converter). Version&nbsp;1.1.0.0 was published in February&nbsp;2005, but was used in "2.4" released in January&nbsp;2005. Version 1.2.0.0 was published in May 2008, but was used in "4.4" released in March/April 2008. Version 1.3.0.0 was first written by beta versions of "5.4" (ACR and DNG&nbsp;Converter) in May 2009, and published in June 2009. Version 1.4.0.0 appeared with with Lightroom 4 beta in2012. The latest DNG specification is freely available from: <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/dng/main.html">Adobe - Digital Negative (DNG)</a>. </p>
      <p>The way the version scheme works is that each DNG file holds its own version (the version of the specification it was written to) in itself. It can also hold the oldest version it is compatible with, (and if it doesn't there is a rule that defines that by default). So even after a new feature is added to the specification, if a DNG&nbsp;writer doesn't use that new feature, the version range in the DNG file would include previous versions. Then a DNG&nbsp;reader checks these numbers, and tells the user that an upgrade is needed if it can't handle this version. Perhaps some raw converters would decide not to handle that new feature. They would still be able to handle DNGs for cameras that didn't use it. </p>
      <p>Ideally, DNG&nbsp;readers will continue to accept all versions from 1.0.0.0 up to the latest they are able to support. After all, many photographs are held in version 1.0.0.0 DNG files. But it is also expected that converters will always be available to create later versions from earlier versions. For example, Adobe's DNG&nbsp;Converters from "3.2" to "4.3.1" can read version 1.0.0.0 files and create version 1.1.0.0 DNG files from them. (Equally, some products before "3.2" can read version 1.1.0.0 files and create version 1.0.0.0 DNG files from them, but this has limited use!) </p>

      <h2>Sensor areas: active area, crop area, masked pixels</h2>
      <p>What are the "black masked pixels" that are catered for in the 2nd version of the DNG specification, but not the first? What does "DNG&nbsp;Recover&nbsp;Edges" do? Do these questions overlap? (Not really!)</p>
      <p>DNG treats areas of raw image data as shown in the following image: </p>
      <p class="centre"><img src="./DNG specification_files/sensor_areas.gif" alt="" width="419" height="296"></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>S</strong>: <br>
          The maximum <strong>S</strong>ensor area from which raw data is contained in any DNG files.</li>
        <li><strong>A</strong>: <br>
          The <strong>A</strong>ctive Area, which is the largest area from which a useful image can be formed. For some cameras, this is exactly the same as <strong>S</strong>. For other cameras, especially some Canons, this is a (majority) subset of <strong>S</strong>. </li>
        <li><strong>C</strong>: <br>
          The <strong>C</strong>rop Area, which is the subset of the <strong>A</strong>ctive Area which many raw converters convert into a useful image. The main reason why <strong>C</strong> is smaller than <strong>A</strong> is to provide some extra pixels all around for a raw converter's demosaicing algorithm to use. (There are other reasons too, for example to cater for different aspect ratios).

      <ul>
        <li><strong>DNG version 1.0.0.0</strong><br>
          This only recognises <strong>A</strong> and <strong>C</strong>. It discards raw image data outside <strong>A</strong>.<code><br>
          ImageWidth</code> &amp; <code>ImageLength</code> refer to the size of <strong>A</strong>.<code><br>
          DefaultCropOrigin</code> &amp; <code>DefaultCropSize</code> refer to <strong>C</strong>.</li>
        <li><strong>DNG version 1.1.0.0</strong><br>
          This recognises <em>all</em> of these areas. It retains <em>all</em> raw image data within <strong>S</strong>.<code><br>
          ImageWidth</code> &amp; <code>ImageLength</code> refer to the size of <strong>S</strong>.<code><br>

      <p>(Thomas&nbsp;Knoll's <a href="http://www.luminous-landscape.com/contents/DNG-Recover-Edges.shtml">DNG&nbsp;Recover&nbsp;Edges</a>).</p>
      <p>This simply makes <strong>C</strong> equal to <strong>A</strong>. <code>DefaultCropOrigin</code> becomes (0,0) and <code>DefaultCropSize</code> becomes the same as that of <code>ActiveArea</code>. (This may cause problems for some raw converters, because those extra edge-pixels are used by demosaicing algorithms). </p>
      <h4>Example - Canon&nbsp;5D</h4>
      <p>The Canon 5D was first supported in "3.3", so normally DNG&nbsp;conversions are to version&nbsp;1.1.0.0. But those DNGs can be converted to version&nbsp;1.0.0.0, for example by using the 3.1&nbsp;DNG&nbsp;Converter, and the following table shows some differences between version&nbsp;1.0.0.0 and version&nbsp;1.1.0.0 for this camera.</p>

      <h4>A source of frustration for Fujifilm camera users</h4>
      <p>Fewer raw converters can process raw image data from Fujifilm "SuperCCD" &amp; "SuperCCD&nbsp;SR" sensors than from Bayer sensors. Some users of Fujifilm cameras wonder why a "common raw file format" like DNG doesn't solve this problem.</p>
      <p><em>But no true raw file format can solve this problem</em>! The photographer's use of "raw" postpones the processing of the raw image data to the raw converter, so that is where the necessary code <em>must</em> exist. Once that raw image data is in the memory of the raw converter, it doesn't make a difference to the <em>code</em> whether it came from a DNG file or a native raw file.</p>
      <p>Here is <a href="http://www.barrypearson.co.uk/articles/dng/profiles.htm#limit">a fuller discussion</a>. </p>
      <a name="linearizationtable"></a>
      <hr>
      <h2>LinearizationTable</h2>
      <p>This enables considerable compression of a DNG file. Whether this is lossless or lossy compression depends on whether the DNG-writer discarded information in order to exploit it. It applies to both <a href="http://www.barrypearson.co.uk/articles/dng/linear.htm">"Raw&nbsp;DNG" and "Linear&nbsp;DNG"</a>. </p>
      <p>Consider an 8-bit&nbsp;TIFF file. Only 256 discrete values per channnel are present. Such a file can be converted to "Linear&nbsp;DNG". But the latter (being linear) does not have the gamma-conversion of the original TIFF file, therefore those 256 values are spread over a much greater range, for example the range 0&nbsp;to&nbsp;65535. Without special treatment, each channel then needs 16-bits to represent it, even though the vast majority of the values of the those 16-bits are never used. (Only 256 out of 65536 values would be used). Instead, the channels can be represented by 8-bit values, acccompanied by a <code>LinearizationTable</code> that applies across all the channels. If such a table is provided within the DNG file, it is a look-up&nbsp;table that enables the 8-bit value to be converted into (say) a 16-bit value, assuming that the <code>LinearizationTable</code> comprises 256 16-bit entries. </p>
      <p>That was a simple example. A <code>LinearizationTable</code> held within a DNG file may have a different number of entries. If 16-bit values are held per channel, the <code>LinearizationTable</code> (if present) may have 65536 entries. (There are rules to govern what happens if there are fewer entries in the table). </p>
      <p>The <a href="http://www.barrypearson.co.uk/articles/dng/products.htm#leica">Leica&nbsp;M8 camera</a> uses DNG as its raw file format. It stores 8-bits (1 byte) per pixel in its raw files. It also stores a <code>LinearizationTable</code> of 256&nbsp;16-bit&nbsp;entries in the DNG file to convert those value into 16-bit values. It can have useful dynamic&nbsp;range, while still having only 256 discrete levels. (The way the Leica&nbsp;M8 derives its 8-bit values from its original larger values is not constrained by the DNG&nbsp;specification. In fact, it converts its original values to 16-bit values, then takes the square-root, making it an 8-bit value. The <code>LinearizationTable</code> happens to square the 8-bit value, but that has nothing to do with the DNG&nbsp;specification). </p>

        <li> Six bytes containing the zero-terminated string "Adobe". (The DNG specification calls for the <code>DNGPrivateData</code> tag to start with an ASCII string identifying the creator/format).</li>
        <li>4 bytes: an ASCII string ("MakN" for a Makernote), &nbsp;indicating what sort of data is being stored here. Note that this is not zero-terminated.</li>
        <li>A four-byte count (number of data bytes following); this is the length of the original MakerNote data. (This is always in "most significant byte first" format). </li>
        <li>2 bytes: the byte-order indicator from the original file (the usual 'MM'/4D4D or 'II'/4949).</li>

      <h2>Why use JPEG lossless compression?</h2>
      <p><a href="http://www.imaging-resource.com/IRNEWS/archive/v06/20041001.htm">Thomas Knoll</a>: "PNG uses ZIP compression, which does poorly on data deeper than 8 bits/channel, which most raw formats contain. I actually tried ZIP compression in prototype versions of DNG, but the compression ratio was much better using lossless JPEG." </p>
      <p>(For information, optional embedded original raw files - <code>OriginalRawFileData</code> - are compressed with ZIP compression. It is the main raw image data that is - optionally - compressed with JPEG lossless compression). </p>
      <p>And which type of lossless&nbsp;JPEG does that mean? In response to: </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>"The DNG specification states ... the JPEG variant must be lossless Huffman JPEG. However, there are TWO lossless compressions for JPEG (apart from JPEG 2000). There was the original method, defined around 1995, which was not very successful, but it worked; this was called LJPEG. Then, in 2004 a new method was adopted, called JPEG-LS or LOCO-I. Both methods use Huffmann encoding"</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><a href="http://adobe.groupbrowser.com/t180484.html">Thomas Knoll responded</a>: "The DNG spec (and Canon CR2 format, plus several Kodak raw formats) uses the old original lossless JPEG standard.

"There is no way to support Foveon X3 data in DNG without publishing intimate details of the off-sensor data, which is Foveon's intellectual property. (It would be pointless for us to define a DNG format that is not documented well enough that other raw converters can convert the data into a displayable image)". X3F files are always <a href="http://www.barrypearson.co.uk/articles/dng/safety.htm#x3f">converted to Linear&nbsp;DNG</a> format. </p>
        <p><a href="http://forums.dpreview.com/forums/read.asp?forum=1027&amp;message=27243758">Adobe's Zalman Stern</a>: <br>
"For X3 sensors the raw sample data is not stored in the DNG unless the embed original option is chosen as DNG cannot specify how to process the X3 data. (We take enough heat for allowing undocumented vendor specific maker notes to be moved over into DNG, which is absolutely necessary. Allowing image data which no one can do anything with short of major feats of reverse engineering would be very bad.) <a href="http://www.barrypearson.co.uk/articles/dng/safety.htm#x3f">Linear DNG is used instead</a>. For almost all other sensors, the raw data is stored fairly directly with no material data loss".</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>What would have to be done for a future specification to support Foveon sensors? Here are the sorts of topics that the people evolving the specification for layered data would have to resolve:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>There is no problem with holding the raw image data itself. DNG (in fact ISO 12234-2 that is was based on) has <code>SamplesPerPixel</code> and <code>BitsPerSample</code> tags. (DNG uses <code>SamplesPerPixel</code>&nbsp;=&nbsp;2 for <a href="http://www.barrypearson.co.uk/articles/dng/specification.htm#fujifilm">Fujifilm&nbsp;SuperCCD&nbsp;sensors</a>). </li>
        <li>A harder task is to decide what extra tags would be needed, and to specify them in such a way that a raw converter could render the raw image data by feeding the values of those tags into some algorithm. In effect, those tags would identify the relationship between the raw image data and the image at the plane of the sensor.</li>
        <li>Part of this relationship, the mapping between the raw image data and the coordinates of the image, may not need extra tags. (I believe Foveon sensors don't pose challenges such as unsquare pixels or offset pixels. Anyway, DNG has tags to handle those cases, for Nikon D1X, Fujifilm sensors, etc).</li>
        <li>Probably the main challenge is to define tags to describe the tonal responses and colour mapping. These tags would then be present in each Raw&nbsp;DNG for a Foveon image, providing different values for different sensors. Given the number and complexity of related tags for CFA&nbsp;sensors, there would probably be several such tags, and their definition would be complicated. Foveon would probably have to be involved in their definition. There would need to be extensive descriptions of how to use those tags, just as there is in the DNG specification for how to do some of the mathematics to exploit the existing tags.</li>

            Lossy Compression. The linear DNG data will be compressed providing the flexibility of raw with a significant reduction in file size. (Canon 7D files compress from 24MB to 6MB at full resolution).<br>
            Lossy Compression with Downsampling. Lossy compressed DNG files can be reduced in resolution through a Lightroom export process. (There are a number of resolution decreasing options in the export dialog).</p>
