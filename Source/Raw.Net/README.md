# Raw.net
This is a C# library for use in any UWP application.
It can read the exif, the thumbnail and the raw image from a lot of camera model

It's made from my own work, from dcraw.c(https://www.cybercom.net/~dcoffin/dcraw/) and from RawSpeed(https://github.com/klauspost/rawspeed)

## How to use
###Setup
###Open the image
###Get and display the thumbnail
###Reading the raw
###

##Camera supported
For now, only some Nikon, uncompressed TIFF and JPEG format

##TODO
- add more camera
- Demosaic algorithm
- Correct color from camer to other color space
- Get the correct Exif with the correct value
